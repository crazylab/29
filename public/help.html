		<h1 class="heading">Introduction</h1>
		<ul>This is a team game, there will be 2 teams and each team will consists of 2 players.</ul>
		<ul>From a standard deck of 52 cards 32 cards are taken. 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K & A
				from each color suit(Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds).The aim of the game is to win
				tricks containing valuable cards. The values of the cards are according to priority:<br>
				J - 3 points<br>
				9 - 2 points<br>
				A - 1 points<br>
				10 - 1 points<br>
				K - no points<br>
				Q - no points<br>
				8 - no points<br>
				7 - no points</ul>
		<ul>This gives a total of 28 points for cards. In some versions of the game,
				the last trick is worth an extra card point, for a total of 29: this total
				explains the name of the game. Most players nowadays do not count the point
				for the last trick, but the name of the game is still 29, even when playing
				this version with only 28 points.</ul>
		<ul>Traditionally, the Twos, Threes Fours and Fives discarded from the full
				52-card pack are used as trump indicators: each player takes a set of these
				cards, one of each suit. The Sixes are used to keep score: each partnership
				uses one red and one black Six for this purpose.</ul>

		<ul>Bids starts from 16 and goes upto maximum of 28.</ul>
		<ul>If the Pair is declared by the bidder or his partner, the effect is to reduce
			by 4 the number of card points they require to fulfil their bid, subject to a
			minimum of 16; if an opponent of the bidder declares a Pair, it increases
			the number of points required by the bidding side by 4, subject to a
			maximum of 28.</ul>
		<ul>If any player bids, the auction continues for as many rounds as necessary
			until three players pass in succession. If the first three players pass, the
			dealer is forced to bid 16, which ends the auction.</ul>
		<ul>If trumps have not been declared by the end of the play, the deal is
			annulled, and neither team scores.</ul>
		<ul>The game is cancelled if any of the following things happen.</ul>
