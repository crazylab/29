			<ul>From a standard deck of 52 cards, 32 cards are taken(7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q,
					K and A from four color suits i.e. Spades, Hearts, Clubs, Diamonds). The
					points of the cards are :<br>
					J  - 3 points<br>
					9  - 2 points<br>
					A  - 1 points<br>
					10 - 1 points<br>
					K  - 0 points<br>
					Q  - 0 points<br>
					8  - 0 points<br>
					7  - 0 points</ul>
			<ul>The above arrangement is according to their priority.
					Here Jack('J') has the highest priority and 9 has the second highest
					priority. Though Ace(A) and 10 carries the same points, Ace has higher
					priority than 10. Among King('K'), Queen('Q'), '8' and '7', 'K') has the highest
					priority, then 'Q', then '8' and '7' has the lowest priority.</ul>
			<ul>Total 28 points from 32 cards.</ul>
			<ul>Twos('2') are used to select trump suit</ul>

			<h1 class="headline">Deal, Bidding and Trump Suit</h1><hr>
			<ul>Deal: The distribution process of cards is called deal. It happens in two stages -
				<ul><li>1st phase : At the starting of the game consecutive four cards are given
					to each player. Based on these four cards, players bid for the right to
					choose trumps.</li></ul>
				<ul><li>2nd phase : After setting the trump suit, second set of four cards are given to each player. So that
					each player gets total eight cards.</li></ul>
			</ul>
			<ul>Bidding : Bidding is similar to auction. It is the process of setting a target of
					points by guessing. At the end of the game a team tends to acquire those
					point or more. The lowest bid point is 16 and the highest bid point is 28.</ul>
			<ul>Trump Suit : It is a particular suit of cards chosen to have more priority
					than all other suits(i.e. Hearts, Spades, Clubs, Diamonds). But each card
					of the trump suit has priority like other suits.</ul>

			<h1 class="headline">How to play</h1><hr>
			<ol>
				<li>The game starts when any player clicks on the deal button.</li>
				<li>Consecutive four cards are given to each player. Based on these four
						cards, players can bid for choosing the trump suit. The player
						who gets the bid table can bid first and other players
						can either bid higher points or pass.</li>
				<li>The final bidder chooses a trump suit and to indicate the chosen suit,
					 places a card of the chosen suit face down on the table, and does not
					 show this card to the other players.</li>
				<li>After setting the trump suit, each player will get another 4 cards so
					that everyone has 8 cards.</li>
				<li>The player who's card background highlighted, can play a card.</li>
				<li>Players must follow the running suit if possible. The player who play
					 the highest card of the suit wins the round, and the winner of each round leads
						to the next. The first player who is unable to follow suit can ask
						for trump suit by clicking on it</li>
				<li>A player who doesn't have the running suit can play any card; there is no obligation
						to play a trump, even for the player who required trumps to be declared.
						After the trump suit declared each round is won by the player who plays the highest trump
						 suit in it, or by the highest card of the suit if it contains no trumps.</li>
				<li>At any time after the trump has been revealed, a player who holds both the
						King and Queen of trump suit in hand can declare that he has pair.</li>
				<li>When all eight rounds have been played, each team's card points will be
						counted. If the bidding team took at least as many card points as they
						bid they will win one game point(1); otherwise they lose one game point(-1).
						The score of the team playing against the bidder does not change.</li>
				<li>The game is won by the first team to reach a cumulative score of plus 6
						game points, shown on the score board. It also ends if a team reaches minus 6 game points.</li>

			<h1 class="headline">Rules</h1><hr>
			<ol><li>Bid starts from 16 and goes upto maximum of 28.</li>
			<li>Bidding always goes on between two players. If first player bids, the other
				 	player should bid atleast one point higher than the current bid to challenge
					that bidder or he/she can pass. If the second bidder challenges the first bidder,
					the first bidder can stay at the current bid point or pass</li>
			<li>If any player bids, the bidding continues for as many rounds as necessary
					until three players pass in succession. If the first three players pass, the
					dealer is forced to bid 16, which ends the bidding.</li>
			<li>Bidding ends when three players pass or the bid point is 28.</li>
			<li>Once the trump suit is selected by the highest bidder and it won't change
				 further in that game.</li>
			<li>Trump cards has its value only after revealing the trump suit.</li>
			<li>If the Pair is declared by the bidder or his partner, the effect is to
					reduce by 4 the number of card points they require to fulfill their bid,
					subject to a minimum of 16; if an opponent of the bidder declares a Pair,
					it increases the number of points required by the bidding side by 4, subject
					to a maximum of 28.</li>
			<li>The game is cancelled if any of the following things happens :
				<ul><li>If any player possesses four jacks.</li></ul>
				<ul><li>If all 8 cards of a player are pointless.</li></ul>
				<ul><li>If the person who gets the first chance to bid has pointless cards.</li></ul>
				<ul><li>If two players of the same team get all of the 8 trump cards.</li></ul>
				<ul><li>If the trump is not declared by the end of the game.</li></ul>

			<h1 class="headline">FAQ's</h1><hr>
			<ol><li>Why the name of the game is 29?</li>
			<p>Ans: In some versions of the game, the last trick is worth an extra card
					point, for a total of 29: this total explains the name of the game. Most
					players nowadays do not count the point	for the last trick, but the name
					of the game is still 29, even when playing this version with only 28 points.</p>
			<li>What is the use of other cards(2, 3, 4, 5, 6 of every suit)?</li>
			<p>Ans: Traditionally, the Twos, Threes, Fours and Fives discarded from the full
					52-card pack are used as trump indicators: each player takes a set of these
					cards, one of each suit. The Sixes are used to keep score: each partnership
					uses one red and one black Six for this purpose. In our game, we are using
					the Twos for selecting trump suit.</p></ol>
